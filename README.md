## TODO
- Time tracking
- Data saved in different format than just a copy of json, maybe ID everything and just save (ID, value) tuples. Build loaders and savers for that format.
- Error tracking. Inputing error reason, screenshot, etc.
- Skipping tracking.
- WA enabling and tracking after expected errors.
- Analytics, data visualizations with data generated
- Anomaly detections, alarms (for example when process is taking long time)
- Track running tasks some way (other than delta between checkboxes clicks). Maybe implament start/pause/finish/failed/etc button within single tasks.
- Make new page for process viewing edditing and creation
